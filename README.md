  # Sentiment Analysis Mental-Health Predictor
### Machine Learning and Mental-Health Predictor

  </a>


</div>

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Machine Learning techniques to attempt to increase the accuracy of understanding public sentiment on mental health issues via social media.

This project will attempt to find a solution to the following:

"How does public sentiment towards mental health issues vary across different conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts) on social media, and how can this sentiment inform mental health interventions and policy-making?"

<h2 id="motivation"> Project Motivation </h2>
The motivation for this project stems from the growing recognition of mental health as a critical societal issue, coupled with the increasing use of social media as a platform for individuals to express their thoughts and experiences related to mental health. 

<h2 id="opportunity"> The opportunity </h2>
The data science opportunity lies in leveraging advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze vast amounts of textual data from these platforms (social media). By automating the analysis of sentiment in mental health-related conversations, we can uncover deep insights into public sentiment, identify key topics of discussion, and track how these sentiments evolve over time. This capability not only enhances our understanding of public attitudes towards mental health but also provides actionable information that can inform mental health interventions, shape public health campaigns, and influence policy decisions. The potential to impact real-world outcomes, such as improving mental health support and reducing stigma, makes this project both timely and valuable. The ability to automate the analysis of sentiment in mental health-related conversations offers several opportunities:

        Real-time Monitoring: Develop tools that can monitor social media in real-time to detect shifts in public sentiment about mental health issues. This can alert mental health professionals and organizations to emerging concerns or crises, enabling timely interventions.

        Targeted Mental Health Campaigns: By understanding the emotional tone and key topics in public discourse, mental health organizations can tailor their communication strategies to address specific concerns, counteract stigma, and promote mental health awareness more effectively.

        Policy and Decision-Making: Policymakers can use insights from sentiment analysis to inform mental health policies that resonate with the public's needs and concerns. For example, detecting a rise in negative sentiment related to anxiety during a particular period could prompt targeted policy actions or public health campaigns.

        Support for Mental Health Professionals: Mental health professionals can benefit from understanding the broader social context in which their patients operate. Insights from sentiment analysis can help them anticipate and address common challenges faced by their patients, such as stigma or misinformation.

<h2 id="keytakeaway"> Key takeaways </h2>
Scalability: Sentiment analysis can process and analyze large datasets, making it possible to understand public sentiment on a massive scaleâ€”far beyond what manual analysis could achieve.

Timeliness: By applying real-time sentiment analysis, organizations can respond quickly to shifts in public mood, enabling more agile and effective interventions.

Contextual Understanding: Beyond simple positive or negative labels, sentiment analysis can provide a nuanced understanding of the public's feelings about specific mental health topics, such as depression, anxiety, or stigma.

Data-Driven Insights: Sentiment analysis can transform unstructured text data into actionable insights, helping to inform decisions in mental health advocacy, public health campaigns, and policy development.

Ethical Considerations: It's essential to approach sentiment analysis with sensitivity, particularly in the context of mental health. Ensuring data privacy, addressing potential biases in models, and considering the ethical implications of the findings are crucial steps in responsible data science practice.

<h2 id="data"> The Data</h2>
The data used for this project is derived from various social media platforms where mental health is a common topic of discussion. This includes Twitter data, Reddit posts, and to build our model we have used the Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health (Kaggle) dataset: 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health. 

This comprehensive dataset is a meticulously curated collection of mental health statuses tagged from various statements. The dataset amalgamates raw data from multiple sources, cleaned and compiled.

Acknowledgments:
This dataset was created by aggregating and cleaning data from various publicly available datasets on Kaggle. Special thanks to the original dataset creators for their contributions.

Each of the 51074 instances are a unique comments tagged with a specific mental health status.
